To include experts insights, one can apply different methods for this, that is called judgmental forecasting. There er different methods for including experts input on the analysis. See below: The Delphi Method: That is an iterative process where experts makes analysis an predictions independently, then the findings are distributed and then they are able to independently make corrections to their output if they feel to. The results are then distributed and they are possible to correct their output The feedback loop ends when they have reached redundancy and they make no more corrections. Thus, the output is different expert views, that you can select between. Scenario writing: you have different experts that write scenarios that are likely to happen in the future, you rank those events after likelyhood. The scenario writing is followed by discussion. Thus they are able to defend and modify predictions. Combining forecasts: This is where you make different predicte analysis perhaps not including the same predictors, then you use the outputs to compute a forecast, that is done either by finding the mean of the forecasts or assigning weights to the different forecasts that now act as predictors. Forecasting and Neural Networks: NN is used to find its own variables, it is particularly good to fill in missing values. Other tools to judgmental decision making: The decision making tree, where you assign costs and probabilities to events. Bayesian statistics, also where you create a tree of probabilities.

Thus the purpose of the Bass Model is to predict sales of a new product, based on questionnaires or early sales The Bass Curve is based on the early adopters and calculates the curve based on their numbers. The model has proven that it only needs very few observations to plot when it is going to peak and at what amount. Basically the model is based on a conditional likelihood with respect to time. In fact, it has shown to predict peak and sales amount based on research and questionnaires prior to sales Then there are some notes on what further research that can be done and some notes on extensions to the Bass Model 3.2.2 Sales Forecasts for Existing Consumer Products and Services: Do Purchase Intentions Contribute to Accuracy? As we know from the Bass Model we can use consumer intentions (questionnaires about whether a person think he will buy it or not) to guestimate the total sales and when it is going to peak, but are we are able to optimize accuracy of forecasts on existing products using consumer intentions? A previous study has shown, that intentions does not improve the model, although the data did not have available the intentions and whether the person made a purchase or not. In this study there is an improvement to the forecast when the historical data is combined with the intentions of the persons. Also they ruled out, the factor that if the data does not have historical data on intentions and sales history. Hence they experienced on their seven data set, that combining historical data and intentions improved the forecast. To be noted is that the manipulated the intentions in different ways to experiment, e.g. moving average, binary (intentions or not) and some other faucets. 3.2.3 Judgmental forecasting A review of progress over the last 25 years, International Journal of Forecasting This is basically just more information on the judgemental forecasting where they tested different set ups, such as groups, bootsstrapping etc. Did not read all of this, it seemed very much like HW9 "],["exploring-patterns-and-forecasting-techniques.html", "4 Exploring Patterns and Forecasting Techniques", " 4 Exploring Patterns and Forecasting Techniques This chapter will elaborate on how one identify patterns in data thus how to account for this.

Identify time dimension Length and periodicity of the forecast Desired frequency Urgency of the forecast Planning of the forecast Data considerations Available and quantity of the data Internal vs. external data Desired frequency in data (annual, quarterly, monthly) Example: Dollar sales instead of unit sales Model selection The pattern exhibited by the data The quantity of historic data available The length of the forecast horizon Figure 4.1: Model Selection Model evaluation Testing the models on the series to be forecast Checking how each model works ‘in sample’ Measures such as MSE, RMSE, etc. used to rank models Fit (in sample) vs. accuracy (out of sample) Forecast preparation Based on the selected model, obtain the forecast Keep possibly competing models See if their combination yields mode accuracy Presentation of forecast result Clear communication Keep it as simple as possible Visual aids to support the findings Tracking results Comparison of forecasts to actual values Re-specify the selected model(s) over time if necessary Try other model combinations to keep the accuracy level intact Conclusion: One should realize that it is an iterative process, that one must be aware of. "],["data-patterns-and-terminology.html", "4.2 Data Patterns and terminology", " 4.2 Data Patterns and terminology Basically the data is assumed to consist of up to four components, that is: Trend Long-term change in the level of data Positive vs. negative trends Stationary series have no trend Example: Increasing technology leading to increase in productivity Seasonal Repeated regular variation the level of data Example: Number of tourists in Mallorca Cyclical Wavelike upward and downward movements around the long-term trend Longer duration than seasonal fluctuations Example: Business cycles Note, this is very often to identify Irregular Random fluctuations Possibly carrying more dynamics than just deterministic ones Hardest to capture in a forecasting model The four components may look similar to this: Figure 4.2: Components in a timeseries 4.2.1 Terminology \\(Y_t\\): Denotes a time series variable \\(\\hat{Y_t}\\): Denotes the foretasted value of \\(Y_t\\) \\(e_t=Y_t-\\hat{Y_t}\\): Denotes the residual or the forecast error. \\(Y_{t-k}\\): Denotes a time series variable lagged by k periods. 4.2.1.1 Autocorrelation Autocorrelation: is the correlation between a time series and its past (lagged) observations. To identify this, one can merely compare the lagged values as a series for itself, hence comparing actual time series against the lagged time series. This can be written as: \\[r_k=\\frac{\\sum_{t=k+1}^n\\left(Y_{t\\ }-\\hat{Y}\\right)}{\\sum_{t=1}^n\\left(Y_t-\\hat{Y}\\right)^{^2}}\\] Where \\(k = 0,1,2,...\\), hence take on numbers, typically whole numbers, as the result must be measurable. We assess autocorrelation to identify if the data have a trend, seasons, cycles or it is random? If we have seasons, trends or cycles, we must make the model account for this, otherwise one is prone to have a model where it is just implicitly correlated, but that is merely due to the autocorrelation, as it says in the word, it is automatically correlated, but that also implies, that it is not necessarily caused by the data, but rather other factors, often we see macro factors, that have an influence, e.g. an economic book. Autocorrelation can be plotted using an autocorrelation function (ACF) or merely by using a correlogram, which is a k-period plot of the autocorelation, that looks like the following: Figure 4.3: Correlogram Example Where one wants to be within the upper and lower level. Manually testing for autocorrelation One must: Calculate \\(r_k\\) Calculate \\(SE(r_k)\\) Hypothesis: \\(H0 : \\rho=0\\), \\(H0 : \\rho≠0\\) We apply t-test Where: \\[SE\\left(r_k\\right)=\\sqrt{\\left\\{\\frac{1+2\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}r_i^2}{n}\\right\\}}\\] Although, with normal approximation \\[SE\\left(r_k\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-k}}\\] and test statistic equal \\[t=\\frac{r_k}{SE(r_k)}\\] Thence one merely must look up the cut off values and assess if there is statistical evidance for autocorrelation or not. Alternative: Ljung-Box Q statistic \\[Q\\ =\\ n\\left(n+2\\right)\\sum_{k=1}^m\\frac{r_k^2}{n-k}\\] Where m is the number of lags to be tested. The Q statistic is commonly used for testing correlation in the residuals of a forecast model and the comparison is mate to \\(X^2_{m-q}\\), where q is the number of parameters in the model. 4.2.1.2 Random vs. correlated data Randomness is important for forecast model residuals. One can write simple random model, as \\[Y_t=c+\\epsilon_t\\] Where c is the component and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the random error comonent. That is assumed to be uncorrelated period to period. 4.2.1.3 Stationary vs. non stationary data Stationary series is not trending, where is non stationary series is trending, can both be linear or exponential. The how is it solved? One can merely apply differencing of order k. That is equal to: \\[\\Delta Y_t=Y_t-Y_{t-1}\\] One could also apply growth rates are log differencing instead.

Therefore, the error can merely be written as: \\(e_t=Y_{t+1}-\\hat{Y}_{t+1}\\), being the actual amount compared with the foretasted value. One can make several iterations to account for trending, the growth rate, or seasonal data. Those being: \\(\\hat{Y}_{t+1}=Y_t+(Y_t-Y_{t-1})\\), to account for trending data (non stationary data) \\(\\hat{Y}_{t+1}=Y_t * \\frac{Y_t}{Y_{t-1}}\\), to account for the growth rate, notice that it only assess the growth rate to the prior period. \\(\\hat{Y}_{t+1}=Y_{t-3}+\\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-4}}{4}\\), to account for quarterly trending data, the periods can naturally be changed by changing the formula, e.g. to 12. Simple averages One may assume that it is sufficient to apply the average of all observations, to predict the next period, hence we can say: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+1}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^t_{i=1}Y_i \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Thus one take the sum of Linear regressions Linear regression with a trend: that is normal linear regression, where the trend is added as a counter, which will account for the trend, given it is linear.
