To include experts insights, one can apply different methods for this, that is called judgmental forecasting. There er different methods for including experts input on the analysis. See below: The Delphi Method: That is an iterative process where experts makes analysis an predictions independently, then the findings are distributed and then they are able to independently make corrections to their output if they feel to. The results are then distributed and they are possible to correct their output The feedback loop ends when they have reached redundancy and they make no more corrections. Thus, the output is different expert views, that you can select between. Scenario writing: you have different experts that write scenarios that are likely to happen in the future, you rank those events after likelyhood. The scenario writing is followed by discussion. Thus they are able to defend and modify predictions. Combining forecasts: This is where you make different predicte analysis perhaps not including the same predictors, then you use the outputs to compute a forecast, that is done either by finding the mean of the forecasts or assigning weights to the different forecasts that now act as predictors. Forecasting and Neural Networks: NN is used to find its own variables, it is particularly good to fill in missing values. Other tools to judgmental decision making: The decision making tree, where you assign costs and probabilities to events. Bayesian statistics, also where you create a tree of probabilities.

Thus the purpose of the Bass Model is to predict sales of a new product, based on questionnaires or early sales The Bass Curve is based on the early adopters and calculates the curve based on their numbers. The model has proven that it only needs very few observations to plot when it is going to peak and at what amount. Basically the model is based on a conditional likelihood with respect to time. In fact, it has shown to predict peak and sales amount based on research and questionnaires prior to sales Then there are some notes on what further research that can be done and some notes on extensions to the Bass Model 3.2.2 Sales Forecasts for Existing Consumer Products and Services: Do Purchase Intentions Contribute to Accuracy? As we know from the Bass Model we can use consumer intentions (questionnaires about whether a person think he will buy it or not) to guestimate the total sales and when it is going to peak, but are we are able to optimize accuracy of forecasts on existing products using consumer intentions? A previous study has shown, that intentions does not improve the model, although the data did not have available the intentions and whether the person made a purchase or not. In this study there is an improvement to the forecast when the historical data is combined with the intentions of the persons. Also they ruled out, the factor that if the data does not have historical data on intentions and sales history. Hence they experienced on their seven data set, that combining historical data and intentions improved the forecast. To be noted is that the manipulated the intentions in different ways to experiment, e.g. moving average, binary (intentions or not) and some other faucets. 3.2.3 Judgmental forecasting A review of progress over the last 25 years, International Journal of Forecasting This is basically just more information on the judgemental forecasting where they tested different set ups, such as groups, bootsstrapping etc. Did not read all of this, it seemed very much like HW9 "],["exploring-patterns-and-forecasting-techniques.html", "4 Exploring Patterns and Forecasting Techniques", " 4 Exploring Patterns and Forecasting Techniques This chapter will elaborate on how one identify patterns in data thus how to account for this.

Identify time dimension Length and periodicity of the forecast Desired frequency Urgency of the forecast Planning of the forecast Data considerations Available and quantity of the data Internal vs. external data Desired frequency in data (annual, quarterly, monthly) Example: Dollar sales instead of unit sales Model selection The pattern exhibited by the data The quantity of historic data available The length of the forecast horizon Figure 4.1: Model Selection Model evaluation Testing the models on the series to be forecast Checking how each model works ‘in sample’ Measures such as MSE, RMSE, etc. used to rank models Fit (in sample) vs. accuracy (out of sample) Forecast preparation Based on the selected model, obtain the forecast Keep possibly competing models See if their combination yields mode accuracy Presentation of forecast result Clear communication Keep it as simple as possible Visual aids to support the findings Tracking results Comparison of forecasts to actual values Re-specify the selected model(s) over time if necessary Try other model combinations to keep the accuracy level intact Conclusion: One should realize that it is an iterative process, that one must be aware of. "],["data-patterns-and-terminology.html", "4.2 Data Patterns and terminology", " 4.2 Data Patterns and terminology Basically the data is assumed to consist of up to four components, that is: Trend Long-term change in the level of data Positive vs. negative trends Stationary series have no trend Example: Increasing technology leading to increase in productivity Seasonal Repeated regular variation the level of data Example: Number of tourists in Mallorca Cyclical Wavelike upward and downward movements around the long-term trend Longer duration than seasonal fluctuations Example: Business cycles Note, this is very often to identify Irregular Random fluctuations Possibly carrying more dynamics than just deterministic ones Hardest to capture in a forecasting model The four components may look similar to this: Figure 4.2: Components in a timeseries 4.2.1 Terminology \\(Y_t\\): Denotes a time series variable \\(\\hat{Y_t}\\): Denotes the foretasted value of \\(Y_t\\) \\(e_t=Y_t-\\hat{Y_t}\\): Denotes the residual or the forecast error. \\(Y_{t-k}\\): Denotes a time series variable lagged by k periods. 4.2.1.1 Autocorrelation Autocorrelation: is the correlation between a time series and its past (lagged) observations. To identify this, one can merely compare the lagged values as a series for itself, hence comparing actual time series against the lagged time series. This can be written as: \\[r_k=\\frac{\\sum_{t=k+1}^n\\left(Y_{t\\ }-\\hat{Y}\\right)}{\\sum_{t=1}^n\\left(Y_t-\\hat{Y}\\right)^{^2}}\\] Where \\(k = 0,1,2,...\\), hence take on numbers, typically whole numbers, as the result must be measurable. We assess autocorrelation to identify if the data have a trend, seasons, cycles or it is random? If we have seasons, trends or cycles, we must make the model account for this, otherwise one is prone to have a model where it is just implicitly correlated, but that is merely due to the autocorrelation, as it says in the word, it is automatically correlated, but that also implies, that it is not necessarily caused by the data, but rather other factors, often we see macro factors, that have an influence, e.g. an economic book. Autocorrelation can be plotted using an autocorrelation function (ACF) or merely by using a correlogram, which is a k-period plot of the autocorelation, that looks like the following: Figure 4.3: Correlogram Example Where one wants to be within the upper and lower level. Manually testing for autocorrelation One must: Calculate \\(r_k\\) Calculate \\(SE(r_k)\\) Hypothesis: \\(H0 : \\rho=0\\), \\(H0 : \\rho≠0\\) We apply t-test Where: \\[SE\\left(r_k\\right)=\\sqrt{\\left\\{\\frac{1+2\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}r_i^2}{n}\\right\\}}\\] Although, with normal approximation \\[SE\\left(r_k\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-k}}\\] and test statistic equal \\[t=\\frac{r_k}{SE(r_k)}\\] Thence one merely must look up the cut off values and assess if there is statistical evidance for autocorrelation or not. Alternative: Ljung-Box Q statistic The Ljung Box Q is to identify if at least one of the components explains the Y. Thence H0 = p1 = p2 = p3 = pm, thence we want to reject this one. If not, then none of the predictors explain the Y, thus they are irregular components. \\[Q\\ =\\ n\\left(n+2\\right)\\sum_{k=1}^m\\frac{r_k^2}{n-k}\\] Where m is the number of lags to be tested. The Q statistic is commonly used for testing correlation in the residuals of a forecast model and the comparison is mate to \\(X^2_{m-q}\\), where q is the number of parameters in the model. 4.2.1.2 Random vs. correlated data Randomness is important for forecast model residuals. One can write simple random model, but we dont want complete randomness. Hence we don’t want patterns in our error, where the previous error can explain the next error. E.g. if the data contain trend or seasons, that we have not accounted for, then the errors will be able to predict the coming errors (can be tested by testing errors (residuals) against the lagged errors (residuals)). \\[Y_t=c+\\epsilon_t\\] Where c is the component and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the random error component. That is assumed to be uncorrelated period to period. 4.2.1.3 Stationary vs. non stationary data Stationary series is not trending, where is non stationary series is trending, can both be linear or exponential. The how is it solved? One can merely apply differencing of order k. That is equal to: \\[\\Delta Y_t=Y_t-Y_{t-1}\\] One could also apply growth rates are log differencing instead.

Notice, that the most recent MA is the prediction, hence being \\(\\hat{Y}_{t+1}\\). One could extend this, by adding this value to the time series and then calculate MA for the period hereafter. We see that the output of the table above is somewhat misleading, as the most recent MA predictinos, are not positioned in the end, but instead where the center actually is. This problem is solvable using filter(). See the following chunk k &lt;- 5 #specify the order of the moving average c &lt;- rep (1/k,k) #remember that simple average is a weighted average with equal weights, #you need to specify weights for the filter command to work yt5&lt;- filter(yt, c, sides = 1) ts.plot(yt5)# &quot;Plotting the MA&#39;s Figure 4.4: 5k Moving Average yt5 #The updated vector of MA&#39;s ## Time Series: ## Start = 1 ## End = 8 ## Frequency = 1 ## [,1] ## [1,] NA ## [2,] NA ## [3,] NA ## [4,] NA ## [5,] 212.0 ## [6,] 216.0 ## [7,] 219.0 ## [8,] 221.2 This we see, that scores are moved to the end, so even though it is the center of the MA, it is now presented as recent values.

One can calculate the beta values by the following \\[\\begin{equation} b_0=\\ \\overline{Y}-\\ b_1\\overline{X} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} b_1=\\frac{\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(X-\\overline{X}\\right)\\left(Y-\\overline{Y}\\right)}{\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(X-\\overline{X}\\right)^{^2}} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where point forecast, hence \\(\\hat{Y}\\) is merely the sum of the linear equation, hence \\(\\hat{Y}=b_0+b_1X^*\\), where \\(X^*\\) is the specific X values.

The residuals can be broken down to the following \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(Y-\\overline{Y}\\right)^{^2}=\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(\\hat{Y}-\\ \\overline{Y}\\right)^{^2}+\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(Y-\\ \\hat{Y}\\right)^{^2} \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] Which consist of the following three elements. \\[\\begin{equation} SST = SSR + SSE \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] The residuals can then be applied for a goodness of fit assessment, where one can identify R squared- \\[\\begin{equation} R^2=\\frac{SSR}{SST} \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] So what can the linear regression then be used for? Inference Prediction Notice, that inference can only be done when the model is adequate, hence the assumptions actually being met. 5.1.1 Assumptions We have the following assumptions for a linear model: The underlying relationship between dependent and independent variable is actually linear Independent residuals Homoskedastic residuals (show constant variance) Identically distributed (In general, normal distribution is assumed) Hence how is the assumptions tested? Some can be done before analysis and others after the model is applied, hence it can be described by the following: Before the model is applied: The underlying relationship between dependent and independent variable is actually linear After the model is applied (doing diagnostics): Independent residuals Homoskedastic residuals (show constant variance) Identically distributed (In general, normal distribution is assumed) Now lets dive into the data Serial correlation and Heteroskedasticity Notice that autocorrelation = serial correlation Serial correlation is where the observations are trailing each other, where heteroskedasticity is where the variance is changing over timer: 5.1.1.1 Serial correlation (checking for independent residuals): We must make sure that the residuals does not have a clear pattern, as that means that some variables has been omitted. This can be assessed for example by: Visual inspection Durbin Watson test, see equation (5.6) Correlogram Statistical test for relationship between residuals and lagged residuals Figure 5.1: Serial Correlation Example Notice, that one should also test for autocorrelation in the errors, that can be done with a Durbin-Watson statistic: \\[\\begin{equation} DW\\ =\\frac{\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(e_t-e_{t-1}\\right)^{^2}}{\\sum_{ }^{ }e_t^{^2}} \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] 0 &lt; DW &lt; 4, where if DW = 2 it indicates no serial correlation (this is the ideal), generally if 1.5 &lt; DW &lt; 2.5 is widely used as an acceptable level. If DW &gt; 2, it indicates negative serial correlation and if DW &lt; 2, it indicates that there is positive serial correlation. One could also use correlation testing by checking correlogram of residuals or testing residuals against lagged residuals Solution Try with lagging the variables 5.1.1.2 Heteroskedasticity: We want the variance to have a constant variance. This can be checked visually, where we dont want to see a funnel shape, as in the visualization below. Figure 5.2: Heteroskedasticity Example This can also be tested with a Breusch-Pagan Test, where the null hypothesis is that all errors are equal, hence null hypothesis, is that the errors are homoskedastic. Solution Try lagging the variables Try applying differences in the observations If one observe heteroskedasticity and can’t get rid of it, then one can apply a generalized least squares method. Although this introduce a set of new assumptions. 5.1.2 Forecasting with a linear trend If the data contain a linear trend, then we are able to make the model account for this trend. Hence we are able to detrend the data, by including a counter as a variable. Another solution may be to using the differences in the observations, e.g., using growth rates. This is important, as if one don’t detrend the data, then the model will merely describe the trend and not the actual values behind the trend, thus you want the model to account for the trend 5.1.3 Exercises 5.1.3.1 Problems 5 pp. 209 df &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Data/Week46/prob5p209.xlsx&quot;) plot(x = df$Age,y = df$MaintenanceCost,) + grid(col = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) + abline(reg = lm(MaintenanceCost ~ Age,data = df)) ## integer(0) coef(object = lm(MaintenanceCost ~ Age,data = df)) ## (Intercept) Age ## 208.20335 70.91813 If age is the dependent variable We see that the intercept is - 1.78, indicating that if there are no maintenance costs, then the age of the vehicle is -1.78 years old, which is naturally not possible, hence we see that the linear relathionship indicates that there will always be maintenance costs. If maintenance cost is the dependent variable We see that the intercept is 208, hence there will be a begin maintenance of 208, which will always be there, and then for each year, it is expected to increase with about 71.

The diagnostics tools are the same as before, significance testing, R square, DW stats, residuals diagnostics. 5.2.1 Multicollinearity Although in MLR one must be aware of multicollinearity, meaning that do we see a strong relationship between independent variables, hence are they explaining the same? To assess for multicollinearity one can apply VIF, which is the following: \\[\\begin{equation} VIF_j=\\frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(j = 1,...,k\\) Thus, we see that Rsquare is obtained from regression each IDV against the remaining variables. We can then have the following outputs: VIF = 1, no milticollinearity VIF &gt; 10, indicates multicollinearity If one gets an indication of multicollinearity, then one should drop one of the correlated variables. 5.2.2 Serial correlation and omitted variables When doing regression, we may observe that the IDVs are correlated with the error term, meaning that the errors are not randomly distributed, hence serial correlation in the error terms. For serial correlation in the error terms, we are able to make use of the Durbin-Watson, see (5.6). 5.2.3 Selection criteria We cannot use R square anymore, as it will never really penalize when we are adding variables.

The variables are highly likely to have autocorrelation Autocorellation: Variables are automatically dependant on each other over time, and the mere aspect of these synergies (patterns) where one will often be able to prove correlation between the variables One approach to assessing time series is by decomposing the patterns by finding the components hereof, these are: Trend(T): if it is linear, then it can be explained by \\(\\hat{T}_t=\\beta_0+\\beta_1t\\), hence we apply the linear function, hence what in statistics is \\(\\hat{y}=\\hat{T}\\) in time series Cyclical(T or C)Note, often included in practice as the trend, as it can be difficult to extinguish Seasonal(S) Irregular(random)(I) These are also called deterministic variables The purpose of decomposing the time series data, can be either for exploration or prediction. Hence you can estimate the coefficients of the components by breaking down the data. Although the typical purpose of time series is exploration of the data and assess if there are seasons, trends etc. and perhaps to pinpoint whether you are above or below the season/trend/cycle. If the Y observations is the sum of the components, then we have additive model, if they are the product of the components, then it is called multiplicative model Time series is typically an additive model, if the variance is more or less the same, it is a multiplicative model if the variance increases with time Note, one can transform a multiplicative model to an additive model by taking the logarithm 6.1.1 Additional on trend Quadratic trend e.g. where we have curvature \\[\\hat{T}_t=\\beta_0+\\beta_1t+\\beta_1t^2\\] Exponential trend e.g. exponentially growing population \\[\\hat{T}_t=\\beta_0*\\beta_2^t\\] NOTE, one may transform this into a logistic trend instead, as continuous exponential trend is not typical 6.1.2 Additional on seasonal pattern One can manually rule out seasonality by adding seasonal index (that is hard coding the expected index in the respective periods) One must rule out other factors before doing this! Seasonally adjusted data For additive \\[Y_t - S_t = T_t + I_t\\] For multiplicative \\[\\frac{Y_t}{S_t} = T_t * I_t\\] One does often take out seasonality to better compare data and also create short term forecasts. 6.1.3 Cyclical and Irregular Variations One can often rule out (or at least smooth out) irregularities by taking the moving average "],["regression-with-time-series-data.html", "6.2 Regression with time series data", " 6.2 Regression with time series data One of the assumptions for regression models, is that the errors are independent (uncorrelated), THAT IS RARELY THE CASE WITH TIME SERIES. Hence one must be very precautions. "],["the-success-criteria-and-process.html", "6.3 The success criteria and process", " 6.3 The success criteria and process The following elaborates on success criteria and the process 6.3.1 Success Criteria Ultimately we want to be able to answer the following: Do we have trend? Do we have cyclical movements? Do we have seasons? Do we have autocorellation (elaborated in section 6.3.3)? If yes: If RHO = 1, then we can take first differences If RHO &lt;&gt; 1, then we can do the generalized differences., thus implies the following: Do an OLS and get the residuals Use the residuals in the following equation \\(e_t=\\rho e_{t-1}+ \\sigma_t\\), using OLS as estimated rho (\\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)) If rho = 0, then 0 autocorellation 6.3.2 The Process Deseasonalizing and detrending based on moving averages and accounting for cyclical moves Note, if you do not have seasonality, then jump to section 2. trend etc. 6.3.2.1 Desaesonalizing Remove the short-term fluctuations If we have even number of periods, one must center the data. Whith odd period numbers, you can merely center with the period in the middle. The procedure with even number of periods is the following: 1. Find the MA_t with equation (6.1) and (6.2) \\[\\begin{equation} MA_t = \\frac{(Y_{t-2}+Y_{t-1}+Y_{t}+Y_{t+1}+)}{4} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} MA_{t+1} = \\frac{(Y_{t-1}+Y_{t}+Y_{t+1}+Y_{t+2}+)}{4} \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] Note, that the MA for each is centered in the center and rounded up to the coming period 2. Then find the centered MA Then do the average of the two periods, which will find the actual center: \\[\\begin{equation} CMA_t=\\frac{(MA_t+MA_{t+1})}{2} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] Notice, that the example is with quarterly MA, hence the MAs are divided with 4, this could have been monthly and then onw would divide by 12. \\(CMA_t\\) is representing the depersonalized data. One can find the seasonal factor by saying \\[\\begin{equation} SF_t=\\frac{Y_t}{CMA_t} \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] This explains whether one as above or below the expect season level. CONCLUSION: IF \\(SF_t &gt; 1\\), then Y is greater than the quarterly (or what other period is used) average or, \\(SF_t &lt; 1\\), then the Y is less than the quarterly average Alternative, deseasonalizing data can be done by dividing the raw data with some seasonal index, that is adding dummy variables for the periods. Although by using the index, one assume, that the same seasonality is the same as preivous periods. 6.3.2.2 Long-term trend Long-term trend, this is estimated from the deseasonalized data. This is estimated using simple linear regression. Basically the detrended data consists of the residuals between the actual data and the estimated data by using the trend variable (the counter 1 to n). Task 1 We must find out if the trend is linear or quadratic. Linear: \\(C\\hat{M}A_t=f(t)=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1t\\) Quadratic: \\(C\\hat{M}A_t=f(t)=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1t+\\beta_2t^2\\) Where \\(t\\) is the time indicator and 1 = the first observation and increases by 1 thereafter. Now we have obtained the centered moving-average trend \\[\\begin{equation} CMAT = C\\hat{M}A \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] 6.3.2.3 Cyclical Component Cyclical component, one can compare the CMA with the CMAT to find the cyclical factor. Thus, the cyclical factor is: \\[\\begin{equation} CF = \\frac{CMA}{CMAT} (\\#CF) \\end{equation}\\] If CF &gt; 1, the deseasonalised value is above the long-term trend of the data. If the opposite, then below. 6.3.2.4 Time-Series decomposition forecast Now we can do the reverse procedure, using the factors, that we have just found. The reverse procedure is assembling the predicted Y based on the factors that have just been found. \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}=CMAT*SI*CF*I \\tag{6.6} \\end{equation}\\] Where, CMAT = T, S is the SF, CF is the CF and I is the irregular component (this is assumed to be 1 given its random nature, if one expects a boom or shock, this can be modeled with) 6.3.3 Autocorellation ALWAYS ALWAYS CHECK FOR AUTOCORRELATION. What to do? You are missing some variable, find the missing variable(s). In practice this can be very difficult. Do differencing Use autoregressive model approach, where you are using lagged variables as variables to predict the coming period We are going to talk about ARIMA (The box and jenkins methodology, more about this in section 7) If our residuals have autocorelation, it means that there is some relationship in the model, that our model does not account four. In worst case, we can end up ‘proving’ some relationships between variables, that are in fact not true, but it is rather autocorellation that is proving the model, and the not the relationship between the variables and the dependent variables.

An MA(q) model: \\(Y_t=\\mu+\\epsilon_t-\\omega_1\\ \\epsilon_{e-1}-...-\\omega_q\\ \\epsilon_{e-q}\\) It is important to notice, that it is not by default an advantage of including both methods, but one should select the appropriate method depending on the looks correlogram ARIMA is specifically good for short term forecasts as it utilize previous observations to forecast future values. It is able to represent both stationary and nonstationary data. Often, one encounter difficulties making correct model specifications, meaning meeting the assumptions. This is crucial for predicting reliable forecasts Key concepts ARMA vs. ARIMA: ARMA is an approach to stationary data. If the data is nonstationary, one must make the data stationary by differencing. leading to ARIMA. Hence: 1. ARMA: When we have stationarity 2. ARIMA: When we have non-stationarity Random walk: this is merely when you have an 0,1,0 ARIMA, hence only differencing. Thus no AR and MA Drift: that is a constant that can be added to the equation. It will make the model tend upwards or downwards. Imagine having an ARIMA 0,1,0 with a drift. Then you will only have the most recent \\(y_{t-1}\\) and then you will have the constant, which will force the forecast upwards if positive and vise verca. The notations for ARIMA are: \\[\\begin{equation} ARIMA_{(p,d,q)} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Where: p = the order of AR d = the order of differencing (integration) (NOTE: if this is 0, then the model is reduced to an ARMA model) if we only have differencing, then we call this a random walk this is I, as it is also called Integration order q = the order of MA, hence if q = 2, then MA for \\(t_{-1}\\) and \\(t_{-2}\\) is included in the regression model. 7.1.1 Elaborating on AR models AR = Autoregressive AR models are appropriate with stationary data This makes sense, as if the data is non stationary (where the variance is constant) This can generalized with AR(p), where p = the order of AR, meaning how many prior periods to \\(Y_t\\) to be included. Then how do we select an apporpriate number of lags?

If not, then one must deal with that 7.1.2 Elaborating on MA models MA = Moving average IMPORTANT NOTE: this has nothing to do with regular Moving Average, as with using past periods This approach applies use residuals (between actual values and fitted values/or forecasted values) multiplied with a coefficient to forecast the coming period. As with AR, we are able to include x amount of previous periods. Thus, we are able to describe MA with: Y_t=+_t-1{t-1}-2{t-2}-…-q{t-q} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation} where: \\(Y_t\\) = the forecast for time period t. \\(\\mu\\) = just a constant that is applied in the calculation \\(\\epsilon_t\\) = the error term as in any other regression \\(\\omega\\) = the coefficients that we are to calculate for each period NOTICE: these can be interpret as wheights put on each period.

Looking at the different model estimations, we see that that e.g., lag 1 of ltn is significant for explaining ltn, where lag 1 of the other variables are not significant and so on. As written in the code, if one was to insert p = 3 instead of 1, then we would merely have three lagged variables for each model, although it will still reflect the same signifances for the different variables. Conclusion: We are not able to explain anything with the other models, since there is statistical evidence for relationship between other lagged variables and the stn, ltn and een. Hence, we may be just as fine, just by doing an AR approach to each of the models, perhaps even just an AR(p=1) 7.6.2.2.2 2. Model diagnostics Now we can make model diagnostics to check for autocorrelation (serial correlation). This executes a Portmanteau test for correlation in the errors (i.e., autocorrelation, i.e., serial correlation). The null hypothesis is that there are no autocorrelation serial.test(var1 ,lags.pt = 10 #It is chosen to be 10, could be anything else, perhaps one could plot it ,type = &quot;PT.asymptotic&quot; ) ## ## Portmanteau Test (asymptotic) ## ## data: Residuals of VAR object var1 ## Chi-squared = 67.353, df = 81, p-value = 0.8612 As the p-value is far above the significane level, 5%, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, hence it is fair to assume, that the residuals are not serial correlated. 7.6.2.2.3 3. Response to shocks in the variables With the following, we are able to deduce how the different variables react (respond) from shocks in the variables. The y-axis expres the changes where the x-axis express the n steps ahead. Hence in this example it is quarters ahead. plot(irf(var1,boot = TRUE, ci=0.95)) Figure 7.16: Resonses from shocks Figure 7.17: Resonses from shocks Figure 7.18: Resonses from shocks First of all, we always see that shocks in the variables always show direct positive (same direction) response in period 0 on its own variable, that makes sens and it expected. As the illustrations above is based on models that contain one lagged period on the model, we don’t include all available information (also, it is likely that other variable explain the relationship). E.g., looking at shocks in stn (the first figure), we see that ltn immediately tend to move in the same direction, where the effect decays over time and after some periods, it will practically be 0. Notice, that some response have confidence intervals that are below and above 0, hence we are not really able to say how the reaction will be, same or the opposite direction. 7.6.2.2.3.1 Exogenious vs. endogenious Terms: Exogenious: if a variable is extremely exogenious, it is not explain or determined by other variables Endogenious: if a variable is extremely endogenoius, it is explianed or determined by one or more variables. This can be used to rank variables based on how much they are affected by other variables, with the most exogenious variable first (This is called Cholesky ordering), hence we rank based on the following principle: lets say, that we have four variables, we want to order according to Cholesky ordering Most exogenious Less exogenious than 1 more than 3. Hence, more endogenious than 1. but less than 3. Less exogenious than 2 more than 4. Hence, more endogenious than 2. but less than 4. Most endogenious Importance! This is important, as it matters in the end how the forecast is done. see slides from lecture 10 page 12. 7.6.2.2.4 4.

T,S and C are what is called determistic components. Where the rest, I, is irregular, although this might contain some properties as well. These properties are called stochastic or random properties Definition on stochastic: having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely. In this chapter, we explore how a time-series that visually does not reflect nonstationary data, can in fact be non stationary. One may observe, that even though the irregular component is often random (being stationary), it may have show nonstationarity. In general, one can do unit root tests, to test if the data is stationary or non stationary. In general, it can be said: Unit Root = Non Stationarity Hence; I have found unit roots in the data = i have found non stationarity in the data The following will explore how Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) can make an assessment of unit roots. 8.1.1 Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test This is basically a test for nonstationarity. Null hypothesis = x has a unit root (i.e. is non stationary) Alternate hypothesis = x has not unit root (i.e. is stationary) See the equation for the ADF in the slides from L11. See exercise 8.4.1.1 with the Dairy Data. "],["spurious-regression.html", "8.2 Spurious Regression", " 8.2 Spurious Regression This is about having nonstationary data, where the nonstationarity is able to prove a relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable(s). Running a regression on this, will not make any sense, as it is an effect that is not included in the model, that is actually proving the relationship. Meaning that you don’t know if the relationship is actually true or not, but you are apparantly with a statistical test able to prove it. Hence we get a spurious regression if: The variables have another variable in common, but it is not included in the model. It is a coincidence "],["cointegration.html", "8.3 Cointegration", " 8.3 Cointegration Although variables that follow each other, may in fact be cointegrated, meaning that they are not just following each other by coincidence, but they actually have a relationship. To check if both series (y and x) are nonstationary and the regression between these are non stationary. Then we can predict based on this relationship. One can also say, that series are cointegrated if they move with each other, e.g., have the same trend. See the following link with an example: https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/cointegration/. Rule of thumb, when the difference between variables is the same, then they are cointegrated This implies, that we don’t have to be differencing as the relationship between the variables are stationary, implying: \\[\\begin{equation} y_t-\\beta x_t=\\epsilon_{t\\ } \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] show stationarity. The intuition is that y less x times a constant value, you will be left with the error terms, that show stationarity, as subtracting the series’ with each other, will take out the unit roots. 8.3.1 Checking for cointegration One must do: Check if the series have unit roots (are nonstationary) Their linear combination \\(y_t-\\beta x_t\\), does not have a unit root (= is stationary) This can be done with an Engle-Granger (EG) test. The procedure sets forth the following: Testing if \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) are non stationary using an ADF test. Regress \\(y_t\\) ib \\(x_t\\) and test if the residuals (\\(e_t\\)) show stationarity, that can be done with and ADF (augmented Dickey-Fuller test, but also a good idea to plot) See an example of this procedure in the exercise with Dairy Data, see section 8.4.1.2 "],["exercises-3.html", "8.4 Exercises", " 8.4 Exercises 8.4.1 Dairy Data Loading the data. We have yearly data and select employment data. df &lt;- read_xls(&quot;Data/Week49/dairydata.xls&quot;) y &lt;- df$emp %&gt;% log() %&gt;% ts() #Frequency is by default 1, that is applied, as we have yearly data tsdisplay(y) Figure 8.1: Visual interptration Notice that we take log, that is done to smooth out extreme values, and make the data more normal. Based on the figure, we are able to deduce: The ts does not appear to show stationarity, that is to be further inspected in 8.4.1.1 That there is clearly a trend The acf does not imply, that the data show autocorrelation 8.4.1.1 Unit Root testing - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) We aim to find out if there is statistical evidence for unit roots (nonstationarity), that is done with the adf. First we make ADF on the time series, hence \\(y_t\\) adf.test(y) ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: y ## Dickey-Fuller = -1.9669, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.5879 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary Note, the null hypothesis is that the data show nonstationarity Based on the ADF on the log of the data, we are not able to reject the null hypothesis, hence the time series does not show stationarity, that is as expected, as we saw from the ts plot. We can take the first order difference to see if we can get rid of the nonstationarity. dy &lt;- diff(y,lag = 1) #lag 1 is default, but shown for explanatory reasons adf.test(dy) #Rejecting the null, so can claim stationarity of the differenced series ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: dy ## Dickey-Fuller = -3.8763, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.0216 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary Now we are able to reject the null hypothesis. We can then look at this visually. tsdisplay(dy) Figure 8.2: tsdisplay dy This just confirms the hypothesis test. Conclusion With ADF, we are able to make a statistical test for stationarity, hence it is able to support the visual interpretation. 8.4.1.2 Cointegration Now we extend the data and introduce another variable, production worker hours, hence \\(x_t\\). As with the y variable, the data is annually and we take the log of the data. As with y, we must check for stationarity, hence: x &lt;- ts(log(df$prodh)) #production worker hours plot(x) The data does not look stationary, lets do an ADF, to make a statistical test for this. adf.test(x) ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: x ## Dickey-Fuller = -2.4693, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.3855 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary We are not able to reject the null hypothesis, hence x being non stationarity (i.e. non stationary in levels). Lets do first order differencing and check ADF for that: adf.test(diff(x)) ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: diff(x) ## Dickey-Fuller = -5.1438, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.01 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary We see that we are able to reject H0. 8.4.1.2.1 Graphical inspection of the data To show this graphically, we can represent the following. plot(y,col = 1,ylim = c(-0.5,2.5),main = &quot;Cointegration&quot;,xlab = &quot;Years&quot;,ylab = &quot;Values&quot;) + lines(x,col = 2) + lines(residuals(lm(y~x)),col = 6,lty = 3) + grid(col = &quot;grey&quot;,nx = 10,ny = 20) ## integer(0) legend(x = &quot;topleft&quot;,legend = c(&quot;y=emp&quot;,&quot;x=prodh&quot;,&quot;residuals&quot;),lty = c(1,1,3),col = c(1,2,6),cex = 0.7) Figure 8.3: Representation of cointegration We see that the time-series’ (which are not difference) are not stationary and the perfectly fits each other. Let us assume, that these are not spurously related, then they are in fact cointegrated. When a regression is run on the two variables, we see that the residuals show stationarity, hence that is a good indication of cointegration. This can be further explored with the following two procedures: 8.4.1.2.2 Test for cointegration Statistical test - Phillips-Ouliaris test (2-step EG test), whith H0: no cointegration This is supposed to be the better option, as it uses the correct distributions, that was just briefly mentioned during class Manual process, consisting of: Fitting y on x Checking the residuals for unit roots (stationarity) using ADF. The following does both: Option 1 - Phillips-Ouliaris test # Combining the two vectors x and y z &lt;- ts(cbind(x,y)) po.test(z) #Note, this is the 2-step EG test ## ## Phillips-Ouliaris Cointegration Test ## ## data: z ## Phillips-Ouliaris demeaned = -33.724, Truncation lag parameter = 0, ## p-value = 0.01 We have H0: no cointegration. We are able to reject the null, hence it is fair to assume that there is cointegration between the two variables. Option 2 - Manual process fit &lt;- lm(y~x) #Running an OLS of y on x adf.test(x = resid(fit)) #Testing if the residuals from the estimated model contain a unit root. ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: resid(fit) ## Dickey-Fuller = -2.7005, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.2924 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary ADF H0: x = non stationary We see that this does in fact not show stationarity, which contradicts with the PO test. Although the adf.test is not always applying the correct distributions, hence it may not align with the PO test, which is what we see in this. 8.4.2 Airpassengers "],["communicating-technical-findings.html", "9 Communicating Technical Findings", " 9 Communicating Technical Findings This chapter is about efficient report writing Litteratur Link to article: https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/learning-teaching/support/approach/steps-to-teaching-success/resources/WSBG-report-writing-guide-2017.pdf Lectures Lecture 6 The following path contain a folder with a template for reports: Business Forecasting/Week 46 Simple Linear Regression/BusinessReportRMD "],["Methods.html", "10 Methods and Performance Measurement ", " 10 Methods and Performance Measurement "],["ForecastMethods.html", "10.1 Forecasting Methods", " 10.1 Forecasting Methods Naive forecasts This is merely the current period is assumed to be the best predictor for the future, hence it can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+1}=Y_t \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(Y_t\\) = the last period, hence \\(\\hat{Y}_{t+1}\\) = the following period.

This can be extended by, Double moving averages, often seen when you need the center value of a period consisting of an even number of periods, where there is no actual median value, thus one can extend the MA with a double MA. 10.1.1.1 Simple Averages One may assume that it is sufficient to apply the average of all observations, to predict the next period, hence we can say: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+1}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^t_{i=1}Y_i \\tag{10.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is appropriate if the data has shown historical stability, thus without seasons, trends and etc. 10.1.1.2 Moving Average (MA) One may apply a moving average instead, accounting for k periods, also one could extend this by adding weights. For practical purposes only a k period MA is show: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+1}=\\frac{Y_t+Y_{t-1}+...+Y_{t-k}}{k} \\tag{10.3} \\end{equation}\\] this may be applied to remove seasonal effect, either by k=4 or 12 if the data is respectively quarterly or monthly 10.1.1.3 Double Moving Average This is simply doing moving averages twice, hence it is an extension of equation (10.3) As mentioned, often seen when one wants the median when using an even number of periods, e.g. 12 months, hence double MA can be applied. \\[\\begin{equation} M_t=\\hat{Y}_{t+1}=\\frac{Y_t+Y_{t-1}+...+Y_{t-k+1}}{k} \\tag{10.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} M&#39;_t=\\frac{M_t+M_{t-1}+...+M_{t-k+1}}{k} \\tag{10.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} a_t=M_t+\\left(M_t-M_t\\right) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} b_t=\\frac{2}{k-1}\\left(M_t-M&#39;_t\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Thence we are able to say: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+p}=a_t+b_t*p \\tag{10.6} \\end{equation}\\] 10.1.2 Linear regressions Linear regression with a trend: that is normal linear regression, where the trend is added as a counter, which will account for the trend, given it is linear. Linear regression with seasonal dummies and a trend: That is making dummy variables for each period, using seasonaldummary(), to have a variable accounting for each period. The you can add a trend variable seq(1,n,1), e.g., linear counter, when having linear trend. See 6.4.2 10.1.3 Non linear regressions Non linear regression with trend Causal regression 10.1.4 Smoothing methods 10.1.4.1 Exponential smoothing This is exponentially weighted moving average of all historical values, meaning that the most recent value will be assigned the most weight. Hence we merely add different weights to past periods, thus there is no specific way to adjust for trend and seasonality, which is a limitation of exponential smoothing, it can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+1}=\\alpha Y_t+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\hat{Y}_t \\end{equation}\\] thus: \\[\\begin{equation} =\\hat{Y}_t+\\alpha(Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\alpha\\) = the smoothing constant, thus is can be between 0 and 1. The higher alpha the largest weight to the most recent observation. Then how to choose the smoothing parameter \\(\\alpha\\)? For stable predictions, choose a high alpha For sensitive predictions, choose low alpha Test different alpha values and compare the models using the performance measures in section 10.2. 10.1.4.2 Holt’s exponential smoothing Exponential smoothing method with adjustment for trend, hence we introduce a new tuning parameter, hence we have \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) \\(\\alpha\\) = Weight to the most recent observations \\(\\beta\\) = adjustment for trend. R will automatically set this, when beta = TRUE Hence the smoothing now consists of two elements: The level estimate \\[\\begin{equation} L_t=\\alpha Y_t+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\left(L_{t-1}+T_{t-1}\\right) \\tag{10.7} \\end{equation}\\] The trend estimate \\[\\begin{equation} T_t=\\beta\\left(L_t-L_{t-1}\\right)+\\left(1-\\beta\\right)T_{t-1} \\tag{10.8} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the forecasting of p periods into the future, can be explained by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+p}=L_t+pT_t \\tag{10.9} \\end{equation}\\] To apply: use HoltWinters() and select parameters that lowers the performance measurements. When one assigns large weights the model will become more sensitive to changes in the observed data. One can either set the initial value to 0 or take the average of the first few observations. If \\(\\alpha = \\beta\\), then we have the Brown’s double exponential smoothing model. If \\(\\beta\\) = 0, then we merely have a simple exponential smoothing. 10.1.4.3 Winters’ exponential smoothing Exponential smoothing method with adjustment for trend and seasonality, hence we introduce two new tuning parameters, hence we have \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) (as in Holt’s) and \\(\\gamma\\) Hence the smoothing now consists of three elements: The level estimate \\[\\begin{equation} L_t=\\alpha\\frac{Y_t}{S_{t-s}}+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\left(L_{t-1}+T_{t-1}\\right) \\tag{10.10} \\end{equation}\\] The trend estimate \\[\\begin{equation} T_t=\\beta\\left(L_t-L_{t-1}\\right)+\\left(1-\\beta\\right)T_{t-1} \\tag{10.11} \\end{equation}\\] The seasonality estimate \\[\\begin{equation} S_t=\\gamma\\frac{Y_t}{L_t}+\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)S_{t-s} \\tag{10.12} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the forecasting of p periods into the future, can be explained by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_{t+p}=\\left(L_t+pT_t\\right)S_{t-s+p} \\tag{10.13} \\end{equation}\\] To apply: use HoltWinters() and select parameters that lowers the performance measurements. When one assigns large weights the model will become more sensitive to changes in the observed data. One can either set the initial value to 0 or take the average of the first few observations. if \\(\\beta = \\gamma = 0\\) the model is merely simple exponential smoothing. 10.1.4.4 Moving Averages, see section 10.1.1.2 10.1.5 ARIMA Decomposition of the time series AR: MA: ARMA: ARIMA: "],["PerformanceMeasurements.html", "10.2 Performance Measurements", " 10.2 Performance Measurements 10.2.1 Error terms Mean error (ME): \\[\\begin{equation} ME=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left(Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t\\right)$ \\tag{10.14} \\end{equation}\\] Mean Absolute Deviation (error): \\[\\begin{equation} MAD\\left(i.e.\\ MAE\\right)\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{ }^{ }\\left|Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t\\right| \\tag{10.15} \\end{equation}\\] Mean Percentage Error (MPE): \\[\\begin{equation} MPE\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{n}\\ \\sum_{ }^{ }\\frac{\\left(Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t\\right)}{Y_t} \\tag{10.16} \\end{equation}\\] Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): \\[\\begin{equation} MAPE\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{n}\\ \\sum_{ }^{ }\\frac{|\\left(Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t\\right)|}{|Y_t|} \\tag{10.17} \\end{equation}\\] Mean-Squared Error (MSE): \\[\\begin{equation} MSE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{ }^{ }(Y_t-\\hat{Y}_t)^2 \\tag{10.18} \\end{equation}\\] Root Mean-Squared Error: \\[\\begin{equation} RMSE=\\sqrt{MSE} \\tag{10.18} \\end{equation}\\] 10.2.2 Multicollinearity VIF \\[\\begin{equation} VIF_j=\\frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(j = 1,...,k\\) Thus, we see that Rsquare is obtained from regression each IDV against the remaining variables. We can then have the following outputs: VIF = 1, no milticollinearity VIF &gt; 10, indicates multicollinearity If one gets an indication of multicollinearity, then one should drop one of the correlated variables. "],["formulas.html", "10.3 Formulas", " 10.3 Formulas auto.arima() from forecast package, automize the orders and drift. With possibility to select ic and selection method (stepwise vs. non stepwise) This may yield an ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] saying that ARIMA is 0,0,0 order, but the seasonality is of differencing order 1. We see that the frequency is 12, meaning that each period is subtracted with the previous period (found the difference). tsdisplay() from forecast package, does acf, pacf and residuals, if the timeseries$residuals are made as input diff() does desired order of differencing Arima(), practically does the same. Although we are able to call another model, hence other coefficients, thus the coefficients will not be estimated again That is pretty useful!!!
